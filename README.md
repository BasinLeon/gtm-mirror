# 🦅 NEXUS::MIRROR
## The GTM Psychology Primitive & Revenue Intelligence Engine

NEXUS::MIRROR is not a "tool"—it is **Oxygen**. It is the logic layer designed for **Sovereign Operators** to audit market noise and refine it into a programmable primitive.

### 🧠 The Refinery (Tri-Vector Hub)
Stop building dashboards. Start building dependence. The engine processes messy market noise through three intelligence layers:

1.  **Behavioral Stance:** Detecting if a target is expansionist or defensive.
2.  **Structural Authority:** Measuring technical velocity and market resonance.
3.  **Neural Gravity:** Calculating the **Intent Momentum Coefficient**. 
    *   *Strategic Note:* A **0.12 score** is the "Market Lag" indicator—the vulnerability where GTM systems break under new capital.

### 🚀 Integration (Shadow Distribution)
We use **Schema Sniping** to bypass the lobby and enter the engine room.
1.  **Deploy:** FastAPI + Vercel.
2.  **Refract:** POST noise to `/api/mirror`.
3.  **Embed:** Receive a verified **Intent Hash** (e.g., `NX-209-REFLECT`) to pipe into your stack.

### 💰 Pricing: The Transformation
Price the transformation, not the effort. Hires avoided > Features built.

*   **The Blueprint ($199):** The DIY Repo + Documentation. (Oxygen for builders).
*   **The Operator ($799 - $999):** **Target Tier.** Pre-configured environment + Implementation support. (Plug & Play).
*   **The Strategic ($2,500+):** White-glove integration + Custom pipe-building. (Full Architecture).
