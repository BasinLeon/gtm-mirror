# 🦅 NEXUS::MIRROR
## The Sovereign GTM Primitive: From Code to Cash

**NEXUS::MIRROR** is a Revenue OS—a sovereign primitive that transforms market noise into high-intent intelligence. We don't build tools; we establish **Revenue Gravity**.

### 🧠 The Refinery (Logic-as-a-Service)
Stop building for "claps" and start building for **dependence**. The engine processes messy market noise through three intelligence layers:

1.  **Behavioral Layer:** Stance detection (Expansionist/Defensive).
2.  **Structural Layer:** Technical authority and velocity scoring.
3.  **Neural Layer:** Intent momentum coefficient (Calculating **Revenue Gravity**).
    *   *The "Aha!" Moment:* A **0.12 score** signals "Market Lag"—a structural vulnerability in Series B environments that breaks GTM systems.

### 🚀 Technical Architecture: Thin Frontend, Thick Logic
We prioritize the **Brain** over the **Body**.
- **Engine:** FastAPI (Python) – The Refinery Core.
- **Canvas:** Minimalist Logic Canvas – Visualizing metadata for builders.
- **Protocol:** API-first – Designed to be a living dependency in existing GTM stacks.

### 💰 Pricing: The Transformation
We price the transformation, not the effort. Headcount is a liability; automation is an appreciating asset.

| Tier | Product | Delivery |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **THE BLUEPRINT ($199)** | The Sovereign Repo | DIY Core scripts + Setup guide. |
| **THE OPERATOR ($799+)** | **Target Tier** | Plug & Play environment + implementation support. |
| **THE STRATEGIC ($2,500+)** | Custom Architecture | White-glove integration + Custom pipe-building. |

### 🛠️ Execution Loop
1. **Define Done:** "Raw Noise in → Structured SitRep out."
2. **Ship Ugly:** Functionality beats flair every time.
3. **Gift Clarity:** Prove the engine works by running a reflection for the client.
