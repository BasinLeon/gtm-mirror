# 🦅 NEXUS::MIRROR

## The GTM Psychology Primitive & Tri-Vector Intelligence Engine

NEXUS::MIRROR is not a "tool"—it is a **primitive**. It is the logic layer designed to be integrated into high-status GTM stacks to provide psychological auditing and revenue signal refinement across three intelligence vectors.

### 🧠 The Tri-Vector Logic
Most GTM tools provide *data*. Nexus provides **Reflection**. 
It processes raw market noise through three refinery layers to output structured metadata:

1.  **Behavioral Vector (AI):** Detects narrative stance and market posture.
2.  **Structural Vector (ML):** Assesses technical authority and inbound velocity.
3.  **Neural Vector (DL):** Calculates "Revenue Gravity" and intent momentum.

### 🛠️ The Operational Hub (GitHub Native)

NEXUS::MIRROR is designed to be run as a **Sovereign Command Center** directly within GitHub.

- **The Operator Console (Codespaces):** Launch a fully pre-configured refinery environment in seconds.
- **The Playbooks (Actions):** Run high-level GTM audits via "NEXUS::OPS" without touching code.
- **Security & Governance:** Managed via GitHub Secrets, Private Logs, and Agentic Security Guards.

### 🚀 Integration (Headless UI)

The engine is delivered as a **Headless API**. You build the interface; we provide the brains (JSON Primitive).

1.  **Deploy to Vercel:** (FastAPI + Next.js)
2.  **Post Noise:** Send a POST request to `/api/mirror`.
3.  **Receive SitRep:** Get a structured Tri-Vector Situation Report.

### 💰 The "License to Build" Model

This is a one-time payment for the **Engine License**.

*   **The Free Mirror ($0):** Public-facing Tri-Vector audit tool. Proves the logic.
*   **The Engine License ($500):** Access to the full Python Source + Private API Key for your own builds.
*   **The Architect Tier ($2k+):** Custom psychological modeling for your specific industry.
