# 🦅 NEXUS::MIRROR | DISTRIBUTION PLAYBOOK
## How to Launch a Primitive (Distribution over Marketing)

The goal is not "Marketing"—it is **Distribution through Credibility**. You are providing a primitive to builders, not a coupon to consumers.

### 1. The "Aha!" Asset (Day 1)
Create a **2-Minute High-Status Loom**.
- **The Hook:** "I've processed $30M+ in pipeline. I took my internal refinery and turned it into a programmable primitive."
- **The Show:** Input a messy list of signals. Show the Tri-Vector Mirror reflecting the **JSON Primitive**.
- **The Call:** "I'm looking for 3 builders who want to pipe this engine into their own GTM stacks. Link in bio/comments."

### 2. The "Mirror" Gift (Day 2-4)
Identify 5-10 **High-Status Founders** or RevOps Leaders.
- **The Action:** Run their company through the `run_audit` command in your console.
- **The Delivery:** Send them the **SitRep** (PDF or Image) via LinkedIn DM / Twitter DM.
- **The Note:** "Saw you're scaling [Sector]. Ran an audit through my Nexus refinery. Here’s the psychological posture of your current market signals. No sales pitch—just thought the structural vector was interesting."
- **Why it works:** It’s a gift of **clarity**, not a request for their time.

### 3. The "Builder Community" Embed (Day 5-7)
Go where the builders live (GitHub, RevOps Co-op, Clay Community).
- **The Action:** Find a thread where someone is struggling with "Lead Scoring" or "Signal Noise."
- **The Response:** "I struggled with this for years at Google and SurveyMonkey. I ended up building a Tri-Vector refinery primitive to solve it. Here is the JSON output for the type of company you're talking about. Feel free to use the logic."
- **The Link:** Mention the GitHub Repo for documentation.

### 4. The LinkedIn "Aura" Post
Use the "Executive Brief" style (Black/White/Gold images).
- **The Headline:** "Revenue is not arithmetic. It is architecture."
- **The Body:** Explain the difference between **Data** (Noise) and **Primitives** (Instructions). 
- **The Visual:** A screenshot of the NEXUS::MIRROR terminal showing the "Gravity Coefficient."
- **The Signal:** This positions you as the **Revenue Architect**, not a tool salesman.

### 5. The "Stack Contributor" Strategy
Find open-source GTM tools or templates.
- **The Action:** Submit a Pull Request or a "Discussion" showing how to integrate the NEXUS::MIRROR API to improve their scoring logic.
- **Why it works:** It puts your engine inside their distribution channel.

### 📊 Distribution Metrics for the $500 Goal
- **10** Gifts Sent (Audits)
- **3** Community Threads Engaged
- **1** High-Aura LinkedIn Post
- **Target:** 2 Sales @ $250/mo or 1 License @ $500.
