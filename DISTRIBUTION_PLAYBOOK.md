# 🦅 THE 30-DAY SURGICAL STRIKE
## Distribution via the "Gift of Clarity"

To clear your first $500, we shift from labor to logic. We use **Shadow Distribution** to establish technical authority before the first call.

### 📅 The 30-Day Timeline

#### Week 1: Pipe Setup (The Substrate)
- **Goal:** Connect a payment link (Stripe/Lemon Squeezy) to your domain. 
- **Action:** Ensure the **NEXUS::MIRROR** v0.1.1 is live on Vercel and accessible via API.

#### Week 2: The "Aha!" Demo (Validation)
- **Goal:** Document the transformation.
- **Action:** Record a 2-minute Loom of the engine running a reflection on a live domain. Show the JSON output. Prove the "Magic."

#### Week 3: Aura Proof (Seeding)
- **Goal:** Signal Technical Authority.
- **Action:** Post JSON snippets and "Reflections" to X and RevOps communities. Use the verified **Intent Hash** (e.g., `NX-209-REFLECT`).

#### Week 4: The Close (Surgical Strike)
- **Goal:** Convert Builders into Licensees.
- **Action:** Send 5 gifted **SITREPs** to high-value targets (Founding Engineers / VPs). 
- **The Move:** "I've diagnosed a **0.12 Neural Gravity** vulnerability in your stack. Here's the schema to fix it."

### 🎯 The "Shadow Strike" Plays
- **Lead Triage Engine:** Target VPs of Sales to stop lead decay.
- **Auto-Enrichment Briefs:** Target SDR Managers to increase meeting quality.
- **Speed-to-Lead:** Target Founders to recover "sleeping money."
