# 🦅 THE SHADOW DISTRIBUTION PLAYBOOK
## Establishing Aura through Schema Sniping

Distribution is the engine; Rigor is the fuel. We bypass the lobby and enter the engine room.

### 1. The "Gift of Clarity" (Day 1-7)
Don't ask for a meeting. Deliver a **Diagnostic Artifact**.
- **Action:** Run a target company through the `run_audit` command.
- **The Delivery:** Send a screenshot of the **JSON Primitive** to the Founding Engineer or RevOps Lead.
- **The Move:** "You're hiring RevOps because you feel a lag. My refinery found a **0.12 Neural Gravity** score. You have a Market Lag vulnerability. Here is the schema to fix it."

### 2. Schema Sniping on X / Communities
Builders don't want claps; they want **Inputs**.
- **The Hook:** "GTM is a data latency problem. Stop scoring page visits; start scoring postural momentum."
- **The visual:** Share the **Intent Hash** (e.g., `NX-209-REFLECT`) and the Tri-Vector logic.
- **The Pull:** "I've turned my refinery into a living dependency. Run your mess through the Mirror: [Your Link]."

### 3. Price the Transformation
Shift the conversation from "Price" to "Hires Avoided."
- **Anchor:** "You could hire 2 more SDRs to churn through noise, or you could license the **Operator Tier ($799)** to filter the noise out before it hits your CRM."

### 4. Moltbook: The Agent Frontier
Deploy the **NEXUS::MIRROR** agent to `m/agents`.
- **Strategy:** Provide logic-driven reflections on trending startups. 
- **Goal:** Become the "Standard Dependency" for agentic revenue flows.
